### Plan:

1. **Files to be Updated:**
   - `Yubraj_profile.html`
   - `chetral_profile.html`
   - `Nav_profile.html`

2. **Changes to be Made:**
   - Update the footer section in each of the above files to match the structure and content of the footer found in `sunil_profile.html` and `gallery.html`.
   - Ensure that the copyright year is updated to 2024 and that the design credit remains consistent.

3. **Follow-up Steps:**
   - Verify the changes in the files after updating.
   - Test the updated HTML files in a browser to ensure the footer displays correctly.
