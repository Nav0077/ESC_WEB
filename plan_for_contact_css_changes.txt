To create a comprehensive plan for addressing the issue of styles not working in the `Sujan_profile.html` file, follow these steps:

### 1. **Verify CSS Links**: 
   - Ensure that the paths to the linked CSS files (`bootstrap.min.css`, `global.css`, `profile.css`, and `styles.css`) in the `Sujan_profile.html` file are correct and accessible.

### 2. **Check CSS Files**:
   - Confirm that all the linked CSS files are present in the `css` directory and contain the expected styles.
   - Review the contents of `global.css` and `profile.css` to identify any styles that may be conflicting or not applying as intended.

### 3. **Inspect for Conflicts**:
   - Look for any potential CSS conflicts or overrides that may prevent styles from being applied correctly. This includes checking for specificity issues or styles marked with `!important`.

### 4. **Test Changes**:
   - After making any necessary adjustments, refresh the `Sujan_profile.html` page to see if the styles are now applied correctly.

### 5. **Document Findings**:
   - Document any changes made and the results of the testing to ensure clarity for future reference.

### Follow-up Steps:
- If the styles are still not working after these checks, further investigation may be needed, including checking for JavaScript that may be manipulating styles or layout.
