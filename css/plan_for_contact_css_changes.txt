Here is the comprehensive plan for executing the CSS changes needed for the contact section:

### Plan:
1. **Update `css/profile.css`**:
   - Modify styles for the `.contact_2_left` and `.contact_3_left` classes to ensure they align with the desired layout and design for the contact section.
   - Adjust any media queries that affect the contact section to ensure responsiveness.

2. **Update `css/global.css`**:
   - Review and potentially modify CSS variables that may impact the contact section's colors and backgrounds.
   - Ensure that any global styles that apply to buttons or links are consistent with the design of the contact section.

3. **Update `css/styles.css`**:
   - Ensure that the header and navbar styles do not conflict with the contact section's layout.
   - If necessary, add specific styles for the contact section to ensure it stands out and is visually appealing.

### Follow-up Steps:
- After making the changes, test the contact section on various screen sizes to ensure responsiveness.
- Review the overall layout to ensure consistency with the rest of the site.
