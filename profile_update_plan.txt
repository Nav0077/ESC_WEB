### Comprehensive Plan for Enhancing the Player Profile Page

#### Information Gathered:
- The `profile.html` file contains sections for player information, statistics, matches, videos, and news.

#### Dependent Files to be Edited:
- `profile.html` will be the primary file edited for these changes.

#### Follow-up Steps:
- Verify the changes in the `profile.html` file.
- Test the functionality to ensure that the profile displays correctly when a player is selected.
